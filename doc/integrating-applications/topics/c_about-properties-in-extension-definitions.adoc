= Descriptions of user interface properties in extension definition JSON file

For connector extensions and step extensions, specify user interface
properties in the extension definiton JSON file. 
After you add an extension to {prodname}, the settings of these 
properties determine the {prodname} console display when you use the 
extension to create a connection, configure an action, 
or configure a step. 

You must specify properties for each element that you want to appear
in the extension's user interface in the {prodname} console. 
For each element, specify some or all of these properties in any order.

The following table describes the properties. 

[options="header"]
[cols="3,1,2"]
|===
|Property name
|Type
|Description

|`type`
| 
|Controls the kind of form control that should be displayed in the UI. 
The corresponding table shows how the field is mapped:
Type Value	HTML Form Control
boolean, checkbox	input of type "checkbox"
int, integer, long, number	input of type "number"
hidden	input of type "hidden"
select	input of type "select"
duration	a custom duration control is used
textarea	a textarea element is used
text, string, any unknown value	an input of type "text" is used.

|`required`
|Boolean
|Controls whether or not the `required` attribute is set on the control, if true then the user will need to supply a value for the form to successfully validate.

|`secret`
|Boolean
|If specified the form control will be overridden to be an input of type `password`.

|`labelHint` or "labelTooltip" - 
|string
|if set, a `?` icon will be displayed next to the label and the value will be shown in a popover when the user clicks on the`?` icon

|`controlHint` or "controlTooltip" - 
|string: 
|If set the value will be used to set the "title" property of the form control, resulting in a tooltip that will appear when the user hovers the mouse over the control.

|`description`
|string
|If set, the value will be shown underneath the control, generally used to display a short useful message about the field to the user.

|`placeholder`
|string
|If set, the value will be used in the form control's `placeholder` property.

|`enum`
|array
|If set, the "type" will be overridden to be a "select" control. The array should contain a list of objects that contain a "label" and "value" attributes. The "label" attribute is used for each select item's label, and the "value" will be set for each select items' value.

|`dataList` 
|array
|Used for "text" fields, will be used to add a "datalist" element to the form control that provides typeahead support for the user. The array should contain just strings values.

|`multiple` 
|Boolean
|If set to "true" for a "select" field (or a field with "enum" set) a multi-select control will be used instead of a select drop-down.

|`max`
|number 
|If set for a "number" field, controls the highest value accepted by the form control.

|`min`
|number
|If set for a "number" field, controls the lowest value accepted by the form control.

|`rows`
|number
|If set for a "textarea" field, controls the number of rows initially displayed for the textarea control.

|`cols`
|number
|If set for a "textarea" field, controls the number of columns initially displayed for the textarea control.

|`order`
|number
|Influences order of controls in the resulting form. The arragement of controls will be lower values first. 
Without specification of the `order` property, {prodname} displays elements in the order in which the `.json` file defines them.
